> [!IMPORTANT]
> _The docker-compose used in this project is configured to allow iframes from any domain. In production, you should only allow trusted domains._
>
> Additionally, for the map to function properly, ensure the following CSP (Content Security Policy) settings are correctly configured:

```yaml
CONTENT_SECURITY_POLICY_DIRECTIVES__FRAME_SRC: "*" # allows iframes from any domain
CONTENT_SECURITY_POLICY_DIRECTIVES__IMG_SRC: "self http://0.0.0.0:8055 https: https://*.tile.openstreetmap.org data:" # allows map images
DIRECTUS_HTTP_HEADERS__CONTENT_SECURITY_POLICY: "default-src *; img-src * 'self' data: https:; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' *; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' *" # sets a global security policy for your application via the Content-Security-Policy HTTP header
```
